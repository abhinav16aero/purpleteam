/**
 * Pure state helpers for the TrafficMind settings dialog.

 * sent on Apply (so at most ONE proxy respawn per Apply, never one-per-click).
 * This module owns the shape of that config slice, its defaults, the
 * server-normalization (`pickCapture`), and the dirty/diff engine that drives the
 * button. It is deliberately framework-free so the diff logic is unit-tested
 * without rendering the modal.
